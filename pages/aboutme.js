            I&apos;m a Full stack developer from West London, I trained at HackReactor in San Francisco in 2017 after having been a Product manager for a digital management consultancy for 5 year. Since then I have been working with entrepreneurs and their businesses to build out their online presence. I deliver responsive websites with functional user interfaces. I enjoy taking projects from ideation phase to full deployment either solo or as part of a larger team. 
                <br></br><br></br> 
            On the Front-End I specialise in the React, React Native and Next.js ecosystem as well as Wordpress custom theme and plugin development. I have developed many full stack applications using node and mySQl based relational databases such as phpMyAdmin and PostgreSQL as well as non-relational object based systems such as mongoDb.
